<h2 class="bbchead"> The Boston Beer Company Work</h2>

<body>
	<p>
	The work on this page is from my co-op working at the Boston Beer Company. All work was made in photoshop using assets from several places and brought together to be edited.

<img src="images/aocoolerwrap_mock.jpg" alt="Angry Orchard Cooler Wrap">

	<p>
	This cooler wrap was made to wrap a wall in a liquor store. I pulled elements from several different pieces of Angry Orchard POS and packaging to create one cohesive wrap. I unfortunately was not able get actual pictures after installation, so I made a mockup of what it would have looked like.

</div>

	<p>
	This poster was made to go along with a grocery store coupon. It incorporated both the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands along with a picture of a pork dinner. The plate of pork was pulled from two different images and edited to be one cohesive plate.

<a name= "bowling"> <img src="images/bowling.jpg" alt="Samuel Adams Bowling"> </a>

	<p>
	This was made to be hung up in a bowling alley to highlight the Samuel Adams Perfect Pint. This image was edited from a vertical picture of a bowling lane that was doubled and merged to look like one long lane. The ball was edited into the picture as well to make everything feel more realistic.
	</p>


<a name= "pints"> <img src="images/pints.jpg" alt="Samuel Adams Pints"> </a>

	<p>
	This poster was made to be hung up in an On-Premise account featuring several Samuel Adams pints on draft. I faced the challenge of making the pints all sit on together while still keeping the perspective as realistic as possible. I think this came out clean and simple, and the sales rep loved it as much as I did!
