	These are images of holiday cards that I designed for the Northeastern Advancement Holiday Card Contest. The object was to create a card that would be sent out to Alumni and University supporters. I came up with two clean designs that captured both the spirit of the holiday season as well as the spirit of Northeastern.

	<p>
	This logo was made for Static Noyze Dance Company. They hosted a show at the Middle East nightclub in Boston and wanted to create a logo for it. They wanted the logo to incorporate the word &quot;Noyze&quot;, which was the name of the show, music, and the Boston skyline. I drew a skyline in Illustrator and incorporated their already existing logo with sound waves.

	<p>
	These awards were made for the Umass Amherst chapter of the National Journalism group called
	<em> Her Campus. </em>
	The group needed awards for their end of the year ceremony to give out to the graduating seniors. The organiztion has brand guidelines such as font and color, so I stuck to those and created the patterns in Illustrator to make a clean, yet elegant design.
